# medminder 
An iOS Application that allows user to manage their medication. This idea was formed during UC Davis Hackthon 2018, and brought to reality using Swift4 on XCode.

## Inspiration
We wanted to help people keep track of their medicine while they're ill, so they don't have to worry about it.

## What it does
Takes in a list of medications, and when you should take them based on the patient's stomach. Calculates a suggested schedule for the user to take their medicine.

## How it's built
Used [Swift4]
We used Xcode and Swift to develop an iPhone application along with Photoshop to implement the assets for the user interface. In addition, we used Firebase as the database to store and manage data from the application's users.


## Challenges
Being able to start from the idea and translate that to a working application.

## Accomplishments and Learnings
We were proud of the fact that we got a product with a working database in the allocated time.

## What's next for Medminder
Implementing more constraints for the medicine, different contraindications of medicines. Fixing up the UI. Storing data locally instead of on a server.
